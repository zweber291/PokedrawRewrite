# PokedrawRewrite
This is a rewrite of the popular web game Pokedraw! It is written using Electron to run the game in an app rather than a browser window.
This version of Pokedraw includes all 898 Pokemon instead of the first 151.

Original idea can be found here (this is not my work): https://web.i-gamer.net/appic/html5/2342/

If someone finds the original creator's name(s), please let me know so I can provide credit to them for the idea.
